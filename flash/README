Docker Compilation
After compiling, follow these steps within the Docker container:

Copy the compilation command provided by the compiler for running Python.
Navigate to the '/esp/flash' folder.
Execute the script "copy_flash_files.sh" with the parameter "<text from the compiler>".
Windows Execution
If you are using Windows, follow these steps:

Run the script "run.py" with the parameter "COMx," where x is the port to which the ESP is connected.
The script will generate a file named "flash.bat."
Execute the generated batch file to initiate the flashing process on the ESP via the specified COM port.
